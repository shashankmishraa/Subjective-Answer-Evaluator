It occurs in chloroplasts and involves two main stages: light-dependent reactions (light reactions) and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During light reactions, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and splits water molecules, releasing oxygen. The energy captured is used to produce ATP and NADPH. In the Calvin cycle, CO2 is fixed and converted into glucose using the energy from ATP and NADPH. This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces oxygen and organic compounds."""),

The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is highly folded into cristae, which increase surface area for ATP production. The space inside is called the matrix, containing enzymes for the Krebs cycle. Mitochondria generate ATP through cellular respiration, particularly oxidative phosphorylation. They also play roles in calcium signaling, cell death regulation, and metabolic pathways. Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes, suggesting they evolved from ancient bacteria."""),

It occurs in three main stages: glycolysis (in cytoplasm), Krebs cycle (in mitochondrial matrix), and electron transport chain (on inner mitochondrial membrane). Glycolysis breaks glucose into pyruvate, producing 2 ATP. The Krebs cycle oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing CO2 and generating NADH and FADH2. The electron transport chain uses these molecules to create a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis, producing approximately 32-34 ATP per glucose molecule. This process is crucial for providing energy for all cellular activities."""),

They are primarily proteins with specific three-dimensional structures that form active sites. Enzymes lower the activation energy required for reactions, allowing them to occur at body temperature. They are highly specific, following the lock-and-key or induced-fit model. Enzyme activity is affected by temperature, pH, substrate concentration, and inhibitors. They play vital roles in digestion, metabolism, DNA replication, and virtually all biochemical processes in living organisms."""),

Each strand is made of nucleotides containing a sugar (deoxyribose), phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C). A pairs with T, and G pairs with C through hydrogen bonds. DNA stores genetic information in the sequence of bases, which codes for proteins. It is the hereditary material passed from parents to offspring, ensuring traits are inherited. DNA replication ensures genetic continuity during cell division.""")
